<h1>PIC Development Kit</h1>
<h4>PIC Development Kit is based on PIC which is a family of microcontrollers made by Microchip Technology, derived from the PIC1650 originally developed by General Instrument's Microelectronics Division </h4>

<h4>The PIC was originally intended to be used with the General Instrument CP1600, the first commercially available single-chip 16-bit microprocessor.<br>The CP1600 had a complex bus that made it difficult to interface with, and the PIC was introduced as a companion device offering ROM for program storage, <br>RAM for temporary data handling, and a simple CPU for controlling the transfers.<br>While this offered considerable power, General Instrument's marketing was limited and the CP1600 was not a success.<br> When the company spun off their chip division to form Microchip in 1985, sales of the CP1600 were all but dead.<br>By this time, the PIC had formed a major market of its own, and it became one of the new company's primary products.</h4>
